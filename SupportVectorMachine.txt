Support Vector Classification
The classification problem can be restricted to consideration of the two-class problem without loss of generality. In this problem the goal is to separate the two classes by a function which is induced from available examples. The goal is to produce a classifier that will work well on unseen examples, i.e. it generalises well. There are many possible linear classifiers that can separate the data, but there is only one that maximises the margin (maximises the distance between it and the nearest data point of each class). This linear classifier is termed the optimal separating hyperplane. Intuitively, we would expect this boundary to generalise well as opposed to the other possible boundaries.
