    "\n",
    "Before beginning a study of logistic regression it is important to understand that the goal of an analysis using this method is the same as that of any model-building technique used in statistics: to find the best fitting and most parsimonious, yet biologically reasonable model to describe the relationship between an outcome variable which is dependent or response and a set of independent variables which is predictor or explanatory. These independent variables are called **covariates**.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "In any regression problem the key quantity is the mean value of the outcome variable, given the value of the independent variable which is called **conditional mean** and it is expressed as **\"E(Y|x)\"** where *Y* denotes the outcome variable and *x* denotes a value of the independent variable. E(Y|x) is read *\"the expected value of Y, given the value x.\"* In linear regression we assume that this mean may be expressed as an euation linear in x ( or some transformation of *x* or *Y*), such as $E(Y|x)=\\beta_{0} +\\beta_{1}x$. \n",
    "This expression implies that it is possible for E(Y|x) to take on any value as x ranges between $-\\infty$ and $+\\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression Model** is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which are *dichotomous(binary)* independent variables that determine an outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "What distinguishes a logistic regression from the linear regression model is this. The prediction is based on the use of one or several predictors (numerical and categorical). A linear regression is not appropriate for predicting the value of a binary variable for two reasons:\n",

    ">Finally, taking the natural log of both sides, we can write the equation in terms of log-odds (logit) which is a linear function of the predictors. The coefficient (b1) is the amount the logit (log-odds) changes with a one unit change in x. \n",

    "#### Interpretation of Fitting Logistic Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to determine what function of the dependent variable yields a linear function of the independent variables. This is called the ***link function*** [see McCullagh and Nelder(1983) or Dobson(1990)]. In this case of a linear regression model, it is the identity function since the dependent variable, by definition, is linear in the parameters. In the logistic regression model the link function is the logit transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ g(x)=\\ln{\\frac{\\pi(x)}{1-\\pi(x)}}=\\beta_{0} +\\beta_{1}x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the regression model, the slope coefficient represents the change in the logit corresponding to a change of one unit in the independent variable (i.e. $\\beta_{1}= g(x+1)-g(x)$). Proper interpretation of the coefficient in a logistic regression model depends on being able to place meaning on the difference between two logits. Interpretation of this difference is discussed in detail on a case-by-case basis as it relates directly to the definition and meaning of a one-unit change in the independent variable. In the following sections of this chapter we consider the interpretation of the coefficients for a univariate logistic regression model for each of the possible measurement scales of the independent variable. In addition we discuss interpretation of the coefficients in multivariable models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dichotomous Independent Variable\n",
    "  \n",
    "We begin our consideration of the interpretation of logistic regression coefficients with the situation where the independent variable is nominal scale and dichotomous(i.e. measured at two levels). This case provides the conceptual foundation for all the other situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the independent variable, *x*, is coded as either zero or one. The difference in the logit for a subject with x=1 and x=0 is\n",
    "   \n",
    "$$\n",
    "g(1)-g(0)=[\\beta_{0} +\\beta_{1}x]- \\beta_{0}=\\beta_{1}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The algebra shown in this equation is rather straightforward. We present it in this level of detail to emphasize that the fisrt step in interpreting the effect of a covariate in a model is to express the desired logit difference in terms of the model. In this case the logit difference is equal to $\\beta_{1}$. In order to interpret this result we need to introduce and discuss a measure of association termed the *odds ratio*.\n",
    "\t \n",
    "The *odds* of the outcome being present among individuals with $x=1$ is defined as $\\frac{\\pi(1)}{1-\\pi(1)}$.

    "\n",
    "   The classification problem can be restricted to consideration of the two-class problem without loss of generality. The goal is to separate the two classes by a function which is induced from available examples and it is to produce a classifier that will work well on unseen examples, i.e. it generalises well. \n",

    "   Support Vector Machines are based on the concept of decision planes that define decision boundaries. A decision plane is one that separates between a set of objects having different class memberships. A schematic example is shown in the illustration below. In this example, the objects belong either to class **green** or **red**. The separating line defines a boundary on the right side of which all objects are green and to the left of which all objects are red. Any new object (white circle) falling to the right is labeled, i.e., classified, as green (or classified as RED should it fall to the left of the separating line).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/graphics/SVMIntro1.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "   The above is a classic example of a linear classifier, i.e., a classifier that separates a set of objects into their respective groups (green and red in this case) with a line. Most classification tasks, however, are not that simple, and often more complex structures are needed in order to make an optimal separation, i.e., correctly classify new objects (test cases) on the basis of the examples that are available (train cases). This situation is depicted in the illustration below. Compared to the previous schematic, it is clear that a full separation of the green and red objects would require a curve (which is more complex than a line). Classification tasks based on drawing separating lines to distinguish between objects of different class memberships are known as hyperplane classifiers. Support Vector Machines are particularly suited to handle such tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/graphics/SVMIntro2.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "   The illustration below shows the basic idea behind Support Vector Machines. Here we see the original objects (left side of the schematic) mapped, i.e., rearranged, using a set of mathematical functions, known as kernels. The process of rearranging the objects is known as mapping (transformation). Note that in this new setting, the mapped objects (right side of the schematic) is linearly separable and, thus, instead of constructing the complex curve (left schematic), all we have to do is to find an optimal line that can separate the green and the red objects.\n",

Intuitively, we would expect this boundary to generalise well as opposed to the other possible boundaries.\n",

    "The simplest way to separate two groups of data is with a straight line (1 dimension), flat plane (2 dimensions) or an N-dimensional hyperplane. However, there are situations where a nonlinear region can separate the groups more efficiently. SVM handles this by using a kernel function (nonlinear) to map the data into a different space where a hyperplane (linear) cannot be used to do the separation. It means a non-linear function is learned by a linear learning machine in a high-dimensional feature space while the capacity of the system is controlled by a parameter that does not depend on the dimensionality of the space. This is called **kernel trick** which means *the kernel function transform the data into a higher dimensional feature space to make it possible to perform the linear separation*.  \n",
