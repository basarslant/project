## Introduction to Logistic Regression Model

Before beginning a study of logistic regression it is important to understand that the goal of an analysis using this method is the same as that of any model-building technique used in statistics: to find the best fitting and most parsimonious, yet biologically reasonable model to describe the relationship between an outcome variable which is dependent or response and a set of independent variables which is predictor or explanatory. These independent variables are called *covariates*.

**Logistic Regression Model** is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which are *dichotomous(binary)* independent variables that determine an outcome. 

What distinguishes a logistic regression from the linear regression model is this. The prediction is based on the use of one or several predictors (numerical and categorical). A linear regression is not appropriate for predicting the value of a binary variable for two reasons:

- A linear regression will predict values outside the acceptable range (e.g. predicting probabilities
outside the range 0 to 1)
- Since the dichotomous experiments can only have one of two possible values for each experiment, the residuals will not be normally distributed about the predicted line.

On the other hand, a logistic regression produces a logistic curve, which is limited to values between 0 and 1. Logistic regression is similar to a linear regression, but the curve is constructed using the natural logarithm of the “odds” of the target variable, rather than the probability. Moreover, the predictors do not have to be normally distributed or have equal variance in each group.


In the logistic regression the constant (b0) moves the curve left and right and the slope (b1) defines the steepness of the curve. By simple transformation, the logistic regression equation can be written in terms of an odds ratio.

Finally, taking the natural log of both sides, we can write the equation in terms of log-odds (logit) which is a linear function of the predictors. The coefficient (b1) is the amount the logit (log-odds) changes with a one unit change in x. 


As mentioned before, logistic regression can handle any number of numerical and/or categorical variables.

There are several analogies between linear regression and logistic regression. Just as ordinary least square regression is the method used to estimate coefficients for the best fit line in linear regression, logistic regression uses maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to obtain the model coefficients that relate predictors to the target.
